# Welcome to my blog website

I'm going to write stuff here that randomly comes to mind. This maybe stuff from javascript/typescript or other languages and tools I find interesting.

## Why Astro

I've always been a fan of react, and traditionally when deploying a site I would choose something like next.js. In this case, however, I wanted something more lightweight. With all the hype surrounding astro lately, I figured I didn't have much to lose.

```ts
const hello = "world";
```
