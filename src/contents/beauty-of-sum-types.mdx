# Sum Types, more like the _best_ types

The sum type the is best thing to come out since sliced bread. In my early days of programming my life was constricted to the domain
of product types. Behaviour was shared through inheritance and polymorphism. There's a fatal flaw with this approach though. It's open
and cannot be exhaustively matched. This is a problem because it means that you can't be sure that you've handled all the variants of a
product type.

## The problem with product types

Consider a Java interface defined like so:

```java
interface Animal {
  String name();
  int age();
  String sound();
}
```

We'll then add some variants:

```java
record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Dog(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Woof");
  }

  public void walk() {
    System.out.println("Walking " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Cat(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Meow");
  }

  public void cleanLitterBox() {
    System.out.println("Cleaning litter box for " + this.name());
  }
}

record Cow(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal {
  public Rhino(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Moo");
  }
}
```

I now have a new requirement I want to model `Animal`s that can be house pets. So now I'll introduce a new interface:

```java
interface HousePet extends Animal {
  default void takeCareOf() {
    System.out.println("Taking care of " + this.name());
  }
}
```

I'll then make sure `Dog` and `Cat` implement `HousePet`:

```diff
- record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Dog(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
- record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements Animal
+ record Cat(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet
```

This is great! I can now use a constraint to handle cases specifically for `HousePet`s:

```java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    animal.takeCareOf();
  }
}
```

I also need to handle specific tasks for each kind of `HousePet`, so I do this:

```Java
void takeCareOfHousePets(List<HousePet> animals) {
  for (Animal animal : animals) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      ((Dog) animal).walk();
    } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
      ((Cat) animal).cleanLitterBox();
    }

    throw new Exception("Not sure how to handle " + animal);
  }
}
```

I've just realized that I can't exhaustively handle all the cases for `HousePet` since it's always open to be implemented. So instead I throw an error.
This works great! I _know_ the only two cases that are `HousePet`s are `Dog` and `Cat`, so I shouldn't have to worry about the exception being thrown, right?

Well, a user of my library decides to implement `HousePet` for their own `Animal` variant:

```java
record Snake(String name, int age, String sound) implements HousePet {
  public Snake(String name, int age) {
    this(name, age, "Hiss");
  }

  public void shedSkin() {
    System.out.println("Shedding skin for " + this.name());
  }
}
```

When they call `takeCareOfHousePets` they get an exception thrown. This is because I didn't handle the case for `Snake` in my `takeCareOfHousePets` method.

```java
// Exception: Not sure how to handle Snake[name=Sneaky, age=1, sound=Hiss]
takeCareOfHousePets(new List<>(new Dog("Fido", 3), new Cat("Garfield", 5), new Snake("Sneaky", 1)));
```

My code wasn't designed for people to add their own variants. However, due to the nature of access-control and interfaces, they can.

Many jaded java developers would simply accept throwing an exception as a valid solution to this problem. However exception throwing is a last resort. It's a
hack to get around the fact that you can't exhaustively match on a product type. I would be so much better if this could be validated at compiled time.

This is where sum types come to the rescue.

## Sum types to the rescue

In earlier versions of java the concept of a sum type was essentially using an enum with an associated value:

We would remodel our code above to this:

```java
public enum HousePet {
  DOG(new Dog()),
  CAT(new Cat()),

  constructor (Animal animal) {
    this.animal = animal;
  }
}
```

So why do we call this a sum type? It's called a sum type because the type is the sum of all its variants. In this case, the type is the sum of `Dog` and `Cat`.

More specifically it's a sum of product types.
